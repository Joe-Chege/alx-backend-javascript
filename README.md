- Modern JavaScript
- ECMAScript 6 (ES2015)
- Statements and declarations
- Arrow functions
- Default parameters
- Rest parameter
- Spread syntax
- Template literals
- Object creation and properties in ES6
- Iterators and for-of loops

### Resources
Learners are encouraged to refer to the following resources:

- Statements and declarations
- Arrow functions
- Default parameters
- Rest parameter
- JavaScript ES6 — Iterables and Iterators

### Requirements and Setup

#### Environment
- Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
- NodeJS 12.11.x

#### Editors
- vi, vim, emacs, Visual Studio Code

#### File Formatting
All files should end with a new line.

#### Testing Framework
Jest Testing Framework

#### Linter
ESLint along with specific rules provided in the configuration files.

#### Setup Instructions
1. Install NodeJS 12.11.x using the specified commands.
2. Install Jest, Babel, and ESLint using the supplied `package.json` and `npm install`.

#### Configuration Files

## ES6 Promises Project

### Curriculum Overview

The repository contains a series of tasks aimed at learning and practicing ES6 Promises in JavaScript. The tasks cover various aspects of Promise handling, error management, asynchronous operations using `async` and `await`, and more.

### Learning Objectives

- Understand Promises, their creation, and usage
- Explore methods such as `then`, `catch`, `async`, and `await`
- Practice error handling within Promises

### Resources

The resources section includes links to articles and tutorials on Promises in JavaScript. These resources serve as references to aid in understanding and implementing Promise concepts effectively.

### Requirements and Setup

To run and execute the tasks in this project, ensure the following:
- **NodeJS 12.11.x** installed (on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS)
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`, `Visual Studio Code`
- Code files should use the `.js` extension
- Testing performed using **Jest**
- Code verification against lint using **ESLint**

Detailed setup instructions, including installing NodeJS, Jest, Babel, and ESLint, are provided in the project.

### Tasks Overview

Each task is located in a designated directory within the repository and contains:
- Detailed task descriptions
- Sample code snippets
- Execution instructions
- Links to the respective files on GitHub

### List of Tasks

1. Keep every promise you make and only make promises you can keep
2. Don't make a promise...if you know you can't keep it
3. Catch me if you can!
4. Handle multiple successful promises
5. Simple promise
6. Reject the promises
7. Handle multiple promises
8. Load balancer
